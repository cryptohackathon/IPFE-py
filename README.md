# IPFE-py

IPFE-py (Inner Product Functional Encryption in python) is intended to provide functional encryption support in python. This project uses the base as the CiFEr library which is originally developed in C by the fentec group. 

As the python is one of the widely used languages, this is my small try to make use of IPFE in python. This function can replace numpy dot function and can securely compute the dot product of x and y (with encrypted x) as per the properties of functional encryption.
